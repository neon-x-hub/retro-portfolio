## **🚀 What's This?**
A **nostalgic, pixel-art-infused portfolio** that makes you feel like you’ve time-traveled back to 1995—except with React, shaders, and a suspicious lack of dial-up sounds.

Playable sections, secret Easter eggs 🥚, and a **fully interactive skill tree** (because why should RPGs have all the fun?).

## **🕹️ Features**
✔ **CRT Filter** – Because *everything* looks cooler with scanlines.
✔ **Retro Mini-Games** – Guess my age? Nah, guess my **favorite coffee**.
✔ **Quest System** – Complete tasks like "View Projects" or "Donate to My Coffee Fund ☕. *I don't drink it btw*"
✔ **Glitch Effects** – For when I *pretend* my bugs are intentional.
✔ **Secret Konami Code** – If you can find it send me a screenshot, DON'T CHEAT!!!! (Try it. I dare you.)

## **🔧 Tech Stack**
- **Next.js** – For *blazing-fast* loading (unlike your old dial-up).
- **React Three Fiber** – 3D? In *my* pixel art? It’s more likely than you think.
- **GLSL Shaders** – Making things glitchy since `#version 120`.
- **CSS** – Because we *could* use `<blink>`, but we have *standards*.
