                    You’ve just psychoanalyzed me through a pixelated guessing game. Or you just got lucky. Or you just don’t care. Or you’re just bored. Or you’re just here for the memes. Or you’re just here to see how weird I am. Or you’re just here to see how weird this website is. Or you’re just here to see how weird I am on this website.

                    Anyways, I’m glad you made it this far. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. But hey, at least you’re here now. And that’s what matters.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you think you can survive working with this level of weird creatre.
